#### Flight Path

This is a living document for an adoption journey that synthesizes the best practices from IBM when implementing a Proof of Concept to adopt **IBM FileNet Content Manager on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)**.

The Flight Path approach has its foundation in IBM Client Engineering's commitment to transparency and openness, exemplified by the maintenance of an accessible solution library founded on real-life customer experiences as captured in this repository. This approach aims to document user-friendly and adaptable landing zones to guide and promote adoption of IBM Technology with an emphasis on innovation, scalability and user experience.
